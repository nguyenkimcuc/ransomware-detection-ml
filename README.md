# Machine Learning model for detecting ransomware transactions

## Project Introduction
Ransomware attacks have become one of the most serious cybersecurity threats in recent years, with Bitcoin often being the preferred payment method due to its pseudonymous nature. This project aims to develop a machine learning-based system capable of identifying suspicious Bitcoin transactions potentially related to ransomware activities. By leveraging various supervised learning algorithms and ensemble techniques, the system seeks to enhance transaction security and support early detection of illicit financial activities.

## Project Objectives
- To analyze Bitcoin transaction data and identify behavioral patterns commonly associated with ransomware payments.
- To implement and evaluate several supervised machine learning models for binary classification: legitimate vs. ransomware-related transactions.
- To develop advanced ensemble learning models by combining the strengths of multiple base classifiers through stacking techniques.
- To compare the performance of individual models and ensemble models based on key evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- To build a scalable, data-driven detection framework that can be adapted for future transaction monitoring systems.
